# SNAPP Workshop Repository
Test repository to try Github, SNAPP workshop 2020

Editing the *Read me* file can be done from the edit icon on the right

* add some more text to the files in R Studio (as opposed to in Github)

## How to update shared code
* collaborator: pull first
* collaborator: add/stage, commit, push
* owner: pull first

## How to resolve a merge conflict
* collaborator: make changes, stage,commit, push
* owner: make changes, stage,commit, push--denied
* owner: resolve changes after merging and then push resolved changes

## Notes on Merge conflicts

*communicate frequently
* ALWAYS PULL before you start
* save the file locally, then commit, then PUSH regularly
* don't hang out for days without doing the above, because then the copy you're using is stale and you will have merge conflicts of epic proportion
